# Muscial.ly Proposal

## Description / Motivation
This is a online musical instrument collection player. There will be a playable piano and drumkit at the least. Our motivation for this is music and memes. :)

## Prior Art
There have been many music players online such as virtualpiano.net that do a similar thing to what we are attempting to create. In these websites, the user uses the keyboard to control the piano, so we will probably do something similar to that.

## Core User Workflow

* The user will begin on the home page, viewing the piano. Here, they will see the piano, along with key bindings, showing how to play. 
* There will be a selector somewhere on the page that decides what instrument is currently being played/displayed.

## Daily Goals

### Tuesday:
By the end of Tuesday, we want to have the piano component(s) set up and rendered on the page.

### Wednesday:
By the end of Wednesday, we want to make the piano playable by setting up all of the audio files and key presses.

### Thursday:
By the end of Thursday, we want to set up the Drumset and make it playable.

### Friday:
We will spend Friday testing/fixing bugs and preparing our presentation.
